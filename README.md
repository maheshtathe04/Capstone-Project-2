# Capstone-Project-2
K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression problems. It is a non-parametric method that makes predictions based on the similarity of data points in a given dataset .

# Model Planning
The analysis involved designing a predictive model using the K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithm. The appropriate value of k was determined using an error plot, and the dataset was split into training and testing sets. The model achieved an accuracy of 88.75% on the test set. A confusion matrix was plotted to evaluate the model's performance.

# Conclusion
In summary, the analysis revealed key insights into iPhone purchase behaviour. Age emerged as a significant factor, showcasing a correlation with purchases. Outlier handling enhanced data reliability. The K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) model achieved an 88.75% accuracy in predicting purchases.
